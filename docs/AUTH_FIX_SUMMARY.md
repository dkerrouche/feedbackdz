# Auth Fix Summary

## Problem
Home page was showing "Go to Dashboard" button without requiring sign-in, even for unauthenticated users.

## Root Cause
Old mock authentication logic from development was still storing auth state in `localStorage` using keys like:
- `feedbackdz_auth`
- `feedbackdz_dev_auth`

The `ProtectedRoute` component was checking these localStorage keys instead of using the real Supabase session.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
**Before:**
- Used localStorage to check auth state
- Had mock `handleAuthSuccess` that set localStorage

**After:**
- Uses `useAuthContext()` from the real auth provider
- Redirects to home if not authenticated
- No localStorage dependencies

### 2. Cleaned up `useAuth.ts`
- Removed debug console logs
- Removed development mode mock auth checks
- Simplified to only use real Supabase sessions

### 3. Added Storage Cleanup Tool
Created `/clear-storage.html` page to help users clear old auth data:
- Accessible at http://localhost:3000/clear-storage.html
- Clears localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies
- Helpful for testing and debugging

## How to Fix Your Current Browser

If you're still seeing "Go to Dashboard" without signing in:

1. **Option 1: Use the cleanup page**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/clear-storage.html
   - Click "Clear All Storage"
   - Go back to home page

2. **Option 2: Manual cleanup**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab → Local Storage
   - Delete all `feedbackdz_*` keys
   - Refresh page

3. **Option 3: Incognito/Private window**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in incognito mode
   - You should see "Sign In" button

## Expected Behavior Now

### Home Page (`/`)
- **Unauthenticated users:** See "Sign In" button
- **Authenticated users:** See "Go to Dashboard" button
- **Loading:** See "Checking session…"

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Unauthenticated users:** Redirected to home page
- **Authenticated users:** See dashboard with their business data

### Auth Page (`/auth`)
- Shows EmailAuth component with:
  - Magic Link tab
  - Sign In tab
  - Sign Up tab
  - Google OAuth button

## Auth Flow (Correct)

```
User visits / 
  ↓
No session? → Show "Sign In" button
  ↓
Click "Sign In" → /auth
  ↓
Enter email + password → Supabase creates session
  ↓
Redirect to /auth/callback → Sets cookies
  ↓
Redirect to /dashboard
  ↓
Check session → Load business by user_id
  ↓
Show dashboard
```

## Files Changed
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Use real auth context
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Remove mock auth and debug logs
- `public/clear-storage.html` - New cleanup tool
- `docs/AUTH_SETUP.md` - Added troubleshooting section

## Next Steps
1. Clear your browser storage using one of the methods above
2. Sign up with a new account at /auth
3. Complete the Supabase setup (run `database/setup-auth.sql`)
4. Test the full flow: Sign Up → Dashboard → Create Business → Create Survey
